## Todo

- Organise code better, particularly around nodes. Make this a more generic object
- More art assets for more nodes, generally update UI
- Finish: passengers and empty nodes first, with UI
- Then:
- Implement story
- Implement shop, and other node types
- Implement ship upgrades (more effects on the situations)
- Implement collections, runs etc.
