## Todo

- ~~Organise code better, particularly around nodes. Make this a more generic object. Done~~
- ~~passengers also, done~~
- ~~Finish: passengers and empty nodes first, with UI, done~~
- ~~Main menu, done~~
- ~~More art assets for more nodes, generally update UI. more passegers~~
- ~~refactor nodes to be more extensible, use object... kinda?~~
- ~~refactor ship~~
- ~~UI for ship, done~~
- ~~Implement story, created custscenes to some extent? can add more here~~
- ~~Implement shop, and other node types~~
- ~~Implement ship upgrades (more effects on the situations)~~
    - animate these too
- ~~make nodes generally more interesting, see gpt response -> delay, animate some effects~~
    - slow them down, kinda done
    - cut scenes -> space to continue, cut scene
    - updated combat node, to have some real basic combat
    - story can offer a bit more lore... interaction
- marketing strategy -> pump out 3 content every day for 30 days (lets go for longer than this?)
    - note: balatro took 2 years to build... and they had a demo/wishlist up
    on steam for months. Earlier user feedback the better though
    - I think initially the marketing content is to drive some interest
    but also attract some loyal fans
    - note the devs blog for reference: https://localthunk.com/blog/balatro-timeline-3aarh

- improve whole world by generating it from seed up front:
    - ✅ TL;DR — How to Make a Random World Feel Cohesive
    - ~~Pre-generate the map (fixed seed),~~ done
    - Improve hints and minimap
    - Divide into regions, each with its own node biases.
    - Use visual and narrative transitions between regions.
    - Add clusters (micro-stories).
    - Leave breadcrumbs or trails for navigation.
    - Give ambient rules per region.
    - Create a final goal (rescue beacon or signal source).
    - partial hints for each direction... to actually make the direction choice have value
- more art assets, alot more, keep them consistent pixels
    - for all nodes, upgrades
- more cut-scenes (at start for more story/context)
- add more events to trigger effects of passengers, start animations
    - more animations in general
- then just add more nodes, characters, make the map scale out
- more menu for signals/collectibles? settings?
- tutorial
- runs/archetypes
- progressive universes
